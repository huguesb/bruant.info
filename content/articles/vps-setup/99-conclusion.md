If you spot errors in the above instructions, please [let me know](mailto:hugues@bruant.info).

Ideally I'd like to [puppetize](http://puppetlabs.com/) or otherwise automate as
much of the process as possible. Any contributions towards that goal would be
much appreciated.

I really want to install my own OpenID provider at some point in the future,
or at the very least route OpenID delegation through my own domain... If you have
done it (or even just attempted it) I'd love to hear about your experience.
