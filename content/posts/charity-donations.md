The pledge
----------

I had been considering taking the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/)
[pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) for a while and through a combination
of long philosophical rumination, procrastination, and plain old forgetfulness, I did
not act until late 2017.

I went most of the way through the account creation process but eventually got turned off
by the extensive request for personal information. I do believe such a pledge serves many
useful purposes, and since I feel that taking it here on my personal site, while arguably
not quite as visible as taking it on GWWC, still fulfills them.

_*I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least
ten percent of what I earn to organisations dedicated to improving the live of others, now
and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.*_

Note that, unlike the standard GWWC plegde, mine does not make the claim my donations will
be the _most_ effective use of that money. I do not believe there is a simple uncontroversial
scalar metric by which many wildly different approaches to improving the world can be rated.
If one such metric existed, I do not think it could be accurately approximated, and quite
frankly, I think it's more important to establish a norm where people are expected do
_some amount of good_ than to hold everyone to an unrealistically high standard and risk 
losing most of them as a result.


Reality check
-------------

Strictly speaking, I fell short of my 10% goal in 2017, only donating 6.1% of my gross
income by year end. I have since donated the remainder and will *not* count it towards
my 2018 goal.

I allocated my charity budget in a handful of broad categories and a few organisations
in each category. For each organization, I give in the following list the percentages
of my yearly donation target.

 * Poverty / preventable illnesses
   - [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) : 34.30%
   - [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/schistosomiasis-control-initiative) : 11.43%
   - [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) : 24.39%
   - [Tostan](https://tostan.org) : 12.20%
 * Civil liberties
   - [EFF](https://eff.org) : 6.10%
   - [ACLU](https://aclu.org) / [ACLU Foundation](https://action.aclu.org/secure/make-tax-deductible-gift-aclu-foundation) : 3.05%
   - [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) : 4.57%
 * X-risk
   - [MIRI](https://intelligence.org) : 1.22%
   - [FHI](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) : 1.22%
 * Misc
   - [laprimaire.org](https://laprimaire.org/) : 1.52%
