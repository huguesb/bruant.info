Hugues Bruant
-------------

My name is pronounced [\[yg\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_French),
which is usually pretty hard for anybody but French speakers. I grew up in France on a
diet of bread, cheese and charcuterie and great was my dismay when I later discovered that
only poor ersatz are available in the rest of the world.

Once upon a time I wanted to work in chemistry. I came to see the error of my way after
[two years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles).
Don't get me wrong, physics and chemistry are fascinating topics: I avidly read Max Gergel's
[autobiography](http://www.sciencemadness.org/library/books/gergel_isopropyl_bromide.pdf)
and Derek Lowe's [Things I Won't Work With](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/things_i_wont_work_with/)
is one of my favorite blogs.

Anyway, I ended up earning a MS in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from
[Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) and spending a semester at [CMU](http://scs.cmu.edu)
as an exchange student. I interned at Google and ARM before joining [AeroFS](https://aerofs.com).

I am a fervent Open Source believer. I have contributed to a couple of projects over
the years and even started [a few of my own](/pages/projects.html).
