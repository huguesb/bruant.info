Hugues Bruant
-------------

My name is pronounced [\[yg\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_French).
I grew up in France on a diet of bread, cheese and charcuterie.

I studied physics and chemistry for a couple years then branched into Computer Science and
Applied Mathematics. I earned a MS from [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) and
spent a semester at [CMU](http://scs.cmu.edu) as an exchange student. I interned at
Google and ARM before joining [AeroFS](https://aerofs.com).

Fervent Open Source believer, I have contributed to several projects over the years
and even started [a few of my own](/pages/projects.html).
