Active
------

Projects I am working on, although activity may be erratic due to lack of spare time.

* [Articulate](https://github.com/huguesb/articulate): a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) plugin
  to ease creation of long-form articles.
* [Expressify](https://github.com/huguesb/expressify): a simple expression evaluator for a
  safe subset of Ruby. Comes with glue to remedy limitations of [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid).
  and packaged as a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) plugin.
* [QCodeEdit](http://qcodeedit.org): framework to create powerful text editors based on Qt4
* [RotiDeCode](https://github.com/huguesb/rotidecode): simple text editor based on QCodeEdit **\[WIP / PLAYGROUND\]**


Abandoned
----------

Projects I have lost interest in. Some are barely functional proof-of-concepts, others are perfectly usable.

* [Edyuk](http://sourceforge.net/projects/edyuk): C++/Qt IDE, from which QCodeEdit is a spin-off
* [ExpenseSharing](https://github.com/huguesb/expensesharing): simple desktop app to keep track of shared expenses
